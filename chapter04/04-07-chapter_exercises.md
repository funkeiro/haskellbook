1. Given the definition of `length` above, what would the type signature be? How many arguments, of what type does it take? What is the type of the result it evaluates to?

**Answer:**
```haskell
length :: [] -> Int
```

2. What are the results of the following expressions?
a)
```haskell
length [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
**Answer:** 5

b)
```haskell
length [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
```
**Answer:** 3

c)
```haskell
length allAwesome
```
**Answer:** 2

d)
```haskell
length (concat allAwesome)
```
**Answer:** 5

3. Given what we know about numeric types and the type signature of length , look at these two expressions. One works and one returns an error. Determine which will return an error and why. (n.b., If youâ€™re checking the type signature of length in GHC 7.10, you will find Foldable t => t a representing [a] , as with concat in the previous chapter. Again, consider Foldable t to represent a list here, even though list is only one of the possible types. We will explain it in detail later.)
```haskell
Prelude> 6 / 3
-- and
Prelude> 6 / length [1, 2, 3]
```
**Answer:** second is wrong because / only works with fractional numeric types, not integers as is returned in the lenght function.

4. How can you fix the broken code from the preceding exercise using a different division function/operator?

```haskell
6 `div` (length [1, 2, 3])
```

5. What is the type of the expression 2 + 3 == 5 ? What would we expect as a result?

**Answer:** Bool, True

6. What is the type and expected result value of the following:
```haskell
Prelude> let x = 5
Prelude> x + 3 == 5
```
**Answer:** Bool, False

7. Below are some bits of code. Which will work? Why or why not? If they will work, what value would these reduce to?
```haskell
Prelude> length allAwesome == 2
Prelude> length [1, 'a', 3, 'b']
Prelude> length allAwesome + length awesome
Prelude> (8 == 8) && ('b' < 'a')
Prelude> (8 == 8) && 9
```
**Answer:**

1 line) works because  both result are 2  
2 line) won't work because list cant have values with different types  
3 line) works because both are of the same type  
4 line) works because both are of the same type  
5 line) won't work bacause they have different types (Bool and Int)
