**Reading syntax**
1. For the following lines of code, read the syntax carefully and decide if they are written correctly. Test them in your REPL after youâ€™ve decided to check your work. Correct as many as you can.

a)
```haskell
concat [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```
**Answer:** It's right.
b)
```haskell
++ [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]
```
**Answer:** It's wrong. `++` isn't a prefix funcion.

**Fixed version**
```haskell
(++) [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]
```
c)
```haskell
(++) "hello" " world"
```
**Answer:** It's right.
d)
```haskell
["hello" ++ " world]
```
**Answer:** It's wrong. Lexical error.

**Fixed version:**
```haskell
"hello" ++ " world
```
e)
```haskell
4 !! "hello"
```
**Answer:** It's wrong. String should come first.

**Fixed version:**
```haskell
"hello" !! 4
```
f)
```haskell
(!!) "hello" 4
```
**Answer:** It's right.

g)
```haskell
take "4 lovely"
```
**Answer:** It's wrong. 4 was mistakenly put into the string.

**Fixed version:**
```haskell
take 4 "lovely"
```
h)
```haskell
take 3 "awesome"
```
**Answer:** It's right.

2. Next we have two sets: the first set is lines of code and the other is a set of results. Read the code and figure out which results came from which lines of code. Be sure to test them in the REPL.

a)
```haskell
concat [[1 * 6], [2 * 6], [3 * 6]]
```
b)
```haskell
"rain" ++ drop 2 "elbow"
```
c)
```haskell
10 * head [1, 2, 3]
```
d)
```haskell
(take 3 "Julie") ++ (tail "yes")
```
e)
```haskell
concat [tail [1, 2, 3],
        tail [4, 5, 6],
        tail [7, 8, 9]]
```

Can you match each of the previous expressions to one of these results presented in a scrambled order?

a)
```haskell
"Jules"
```
b)
```haskell
[2,3,5,6,8,9]
```
c)
```haskell
"rainbow"
```
d)
```haskell
[6,12,18]
```
e)
```haskell
1
```

**Answer:**

|b|c|
